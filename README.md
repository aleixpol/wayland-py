## Python wayland client
This is a very basic but complete, pure python implementation of wayland protocol
- fully type annotated
- integrated with asyncio
- protocol support is added by code generation

## Examples
- Checkerboard window `make basic`
- Render animated metabalss `make metaballs`

## Why
I was trying to figure out how wayland protocol works, and as an exercise implemented it in python
